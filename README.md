# LoL.Ladder using PHP 7.2

This web application allows you to create a custom ladder of players for league of legends 
where you can view the ranking of each player.  

Player data is gathered from the RIOT Api which is available [here](https://developer.riotgames.com/) using the library 
from [here](https://github.com/dolejska-daniel/riot-api#initializing-the-library).
