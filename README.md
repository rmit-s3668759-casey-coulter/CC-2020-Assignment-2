# Toolbox

This application has been created by Casey Coulter and Ido Yaron for the purpose of Cloud Computing in 2020.

Our application/website is designed to be a one stop shop for new tools powered by our users.  The goal of the application is to have users inform us with what they need or want through a form and we will create an implementation that satisfies their goal while making the code public. While the application currently targets the goals of the Assignment, the larger picture is to have an application that implements hundreds of Cloud or engineering tools in one place and providing the users the code to help them understand and learn.
